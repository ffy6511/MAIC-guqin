### 作品说明

- 🎵 本App《钟子期》得名于“**高山流水遇知音**”为精神内核，致力于打造融合美育、疗愈与共创的古琴数字应用，回应传统文化如何以现代设计语言焕新表达的命题。
-  整体视觉以“**青墨山水**”为基调，采用统一矢量语言贯穿界面。从图标到功能按钮，皆以流畅线条勾勒古琴轮廓，结合琴徽符号与弦纹元素，主色调选取黛青、墨黑与月白，营造“虚、远、淡、静”的东方意境。
-  “曲意共生”场景设计可随琴曲动态生成水墨空间。如弹《高山流水》，画面展现瀑布飞流与云雾缭绕；演奏《平沙落雁》，则显沙洲鸿影与落霞天光。用户还可定制亭台、山石等元素，生成专属琴境。
- 🎼 “我的古琴”模块支持琴体外观、材质与铭文定制，以分层交互形式实现个性化仪式感。演奏过程搭载矢量谱与动态指法演绎，降低学习门槛。
- 🏛️ “名琴博物馆”融合矢量贴图与3D交互，实现珍琴细节可视化；“文化辞典”与“大师演奏回放”模块则将琴史、技法、传承知识转译为图文并茂、动静结合的沉浸式体验，助力知音精神在数字时代的延续与共鸣。

### Project Description

- 🎵 This app, "Zhong Ziqi", is inspired by the ancient Chinese story of "Zhiyin" (soulmate), with the spirit of "High Mountains and Flowing Water" at its core. It aims to create a digital guqin experience that integrates aesthetics, healing, and co-creation, exploring how traditional culture can be revitalized through modern design language.
- The overall visual style is based on "**ink-wash landscapes**", using a unified vector language throughout the interface. From icons to functional buttons, smooth lines outline the guqin's form, combined with symbolic motifs and string patterns. The main colors—dark cyan, ink black, and moon white—create an oriental atmosphere of "emptiness, distance, subtlety, and tranquility".
-  The "Symbiosis of Music and Scene" feature dynamically generates ink-style spaces according to the music played. For example, playing "High Mountains and Flowing Water" reveals waterfalls and mist; performing "Wild Geese Descend on the Sandbank" shows sandbanks, geese, and sunset skies. Users can also customize elements like pavilions and rocks to create their own unique guqin environment.
- 🎼 The "My Guqin" module supports customization of the instrument's appearance, material, and inscription, providing a layered interactive experience for personalized ritual. The performance process features vector scores and dynamic fingering animations, lowering the learning threshold.
- 🏛️ The "Famous Guqin Museum" combines vector textures and 3D interaction to visualize the details of rare instruments. The "Cultural Dictionary" and "Master Performance Playback" modules translate guqin history, techniques, and heritage into immersive experiences with rich visuals and dynamic content, helping the spirit of Zhiyin resonate in the digital age.
